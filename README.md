# Express Book Reviews
In this final project for the course Developing Back-End Apps with Node.js and Express , i builded a server-side online book review application and integrate it with a secure REST API server which will use authentication at session level using JWT. Then  i tested the application using Promises callbacks or Async-Await functions.
